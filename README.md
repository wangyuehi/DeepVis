Visualized the relationship between soil attributes through different soil depth. 

Metric for distances was correlation coefficients.

* Interactions
  * Use slider to change threshold. Distances under threshold were merged together to indicate closer relation.
  * Mouse over intersections to highlight specific attrbutes.
